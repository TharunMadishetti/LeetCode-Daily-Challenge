#### Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.  
### Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2  
Output: [1,2,3,5]  

### Example 2:  
  
Input: head = [1], n = 1  
Output: []  
  
### Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1  
Output: [1]  
 

### Constraints:  
  
The number of nodes in the list is sz.  
1 <= sz <= 30  
0 <= Node.val <= 100  
1 <= n <= sz
